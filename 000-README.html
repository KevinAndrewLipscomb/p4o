Abstract
</p>
This document describes additional steps that you must perform, after checking out the p4o project from its repository, to achieve a clean compilation or to execute the application. This document does not cover how to meet other prerequisites, such as setting up an ASP.NET server, creating and populating the database schema, and setting up a cron daemon.

<a class="toc" name="toc-Section-1">1</a> Recommended methods
</h1>
<div class="Standard">
The use of <a class="URL" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS_reparse_point">NTFS reparse points</a> is recommended in this document because it allows Subversion operations to take place without undesirable impact to project environments, and without violating Subversion rules. If you simply exported p4o from its repository and you do not intend to perform subsequent updates or any other Subversion operations on it (not recommended), you can simply make copies instead of NTFS reparse points.

<a class="toc" name="toc-Section-2">2</a> Establish hooks to adjunct projects
</h1>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-2.1">2.1</a> Hook up the KiUsercontrolFoundry project
</h2>
<div class="Standard">
p4o uses UserControls from the KiUsercontrolFoundry adjunct project. The KiUsercontrolFoundry is used by multiple production-eligible projects and is version controlled independently from those production-eligible projects. To hook up the KiUsercontrolFoundry project, do the following:
</div>
<ol>
<li>
Check out the <i>https://kveo-it-project.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/kveo-it-project/trunk/foundry/usercontrol/ki</i> project. Put it in a <i>KiUsercontrolFoundry</i> folder. Make sure the <i>KiUsercontrolFoundry</i> folder is <u>not</u> inside the <i>p4o</i> folder tree.
</li>
<li>
Create a junction reparse point named <i>ki</i> inside the <i>p4o/usercontrol</i> folder that points to the <i>KiUsercontrolFoundry/usercontrol/ki</i> folder. You should end up with two folders inside the <i>p4o/usercontrol</i> folder: <i>app</i> and <i>ki</i>. You can make junction points with <span class="versalitas">Hermann Schinagl’s Link Shell Extension</span> tool or, on Vista-based systems (including Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, and later systems), the prototype commands would be:<i><br/>
<br/>
cd p4o/usercontrol<br/>
mklink /j ki KiUserControlFoundry/usercontrol/ki</i>
</li>

</ol>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-2.2">2.2</a> Hook up the KiDotnetFoundation project (only if compiling)
</h2>
<div class="Standard">
p4o uses object code from the KiDotnetFoundation adjunct project. The KiDotnetFoundation is used by multiple production-eligible projects and its source code is version controlled independently from those production-eligible projects. The object code is already provided as <i>p4o/bin/ki.dll</i> to enable execution of p4o in a production environment, but to hook up the KiDotnetFoundation project for the sake of a clean compile of p4o, do the following:
</div>
<ol>
<li>
Check out the <i>https://kveo-it-project.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/kveo-it-project/trunk/foundation/dotnet/ki</i> project. Put it in a <i>KiDotnetFoundation</i> folder. Make sure the <i>KiDotnetFoundation</i> folder is <u>not</u> inside the <i>p4o</i> folder tree.
</li>
<li>
Create a junction reparse point named <i>ki</i> inside the <i>p4o/lib</i> folder that points to the <i>KiDotnetFoundation</i> folder. You should end up with a folder inside the <i>p4o/lib</i> folder called <i>ki</i>. You can make junction points with <span class="versalitas">Hermann Schinagl’s Link Shell Extension</span> tool or, on Vista-based systems (including Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, and later systems), the prototype commands would be:<br/>
<br/>
<i>cd p4o/lib<br/>
mklink /j ki KiDotnetFoundation</i>
</li>

</ol>
<h1 class="Section">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Section-3">3</a> Put appropriate config files in the application root folder
</h1>
<div class="Standard">
p4o will not run without <i>Web.config</i> and <i>unpublished.config</i> files in its top-level folder. Because the contents of those files are environment-specific, and we wish to keep the canonical ASP.NET parts of the p4o folder tree environment-neutral, those config files are kept in a non-ASP.NET-canonical <i>p4o/config</i> subfolder tree. To put config files that are appropriate for your environment into the top-level p4o folder, do the following:
</div>
<ol>
<li>
If there is no <i>unpublished.config</i> file inside the <i>p4o/config</i> folder tree (this should be true for projects kept in public repositories), copy the <i>p4o/config/template-unpublished.config-template</i> file to an appropriate subfolder of <i>p4o/config</i>, rename it to <i>unpublished.config</i>, and revise its contents appropriately. <b>Do not add any </b><i>unpublished.config<b></b></i> file to any public repository.
</li>
<li>
Copy the appropriate <i>unpublished.config</i> file from within the <i>p4o/config</i> folder tree to the <i>p4o</i> top-level folder.
</li>
<li>
Symlink the appropriate <i>Web.config</i> file from within the <i>p4o/config</i> folder tree to the <i>p4o</i> top-level folder.
</li>

</ol>
<div class="Standard">
From the Windows command line, the prototype commands would be:<br/>
<br/>
<i>cd p4o<br/>
copy config/</i>{appropriate-path}/<i>unpublished.config .<br/>
mklink Web.config config/</i>{appropriate-path}/<i>Web.config</i>
</div>
<h1 class="Section">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Section-4">4</a> Set up cron jobs
</h1>
<div class="Standard">
Some FromPaper2Web applications include features that support scheduled unattended jobs, such as notifications and report generation, data scrubs, and other periodic tasks. <a class="URL" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron">Crontab</a> entries for any such jobs that are part of p4o are located in <i>noninteractive/.crontab</i>.
